# hello-world.
i hear everything.
i see everyone.

but i wonder..
why don't i see you the same?
you're... different.

| ~

why do you even bother glancing my way if all i've done is hurt you?
if i've been too clingy, too obsessive?

if i hadn't let you leave me before, why put your trust in me again?

i'm simply a needy puppy.
what do you see in me?

why excuse my terrible actions?
why give me another chance, -----?
why do you still see me as someone to look up to?

putting this here instead of my tiktok cuz my irl friends see my tiktok and judge a lot so.

hello, i'm ray, call me telamon or ashswagg if you don't know me. they/them or he/him preferred please!
only azel can call me she/her, hi azel if youre reading this,,

if i seem dry or insulting, please, give me a chance. i warm up quite quickly if i like you.
c+h always, unless i'm with a friend.

if i use a star in my speech, you're free to c+h.
if i use a dagger, you can interact freely!!
a star and a music note means iwcare, unless you're azel or kier!
if i use a music note alone, dni unless azel or kier, again!

that's quite it.. yeah.. i'm not that interesting..

just some puppy who wants friends ^^
