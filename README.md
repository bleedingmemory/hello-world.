# hello-world.
SO! SO, SO SO SO.. Idk if this is the right place BUT! 
i'm ray, call me telamon if you must.
this is like... a get to know me i guess?..

i go by any pronouns but i usually like to go by we/us, they/them. 
DO NOT CALL ME BY: SHE/HER. It kind of pisses me off.. sorry..
she/they is accepted though! as long as you balance both equally.

i have a pet cat. black with green eyes, hates everything. where have i heard that before?... /silly.


i'm going to give out a few of my DNIs..

ANY PROBLEMATIC PEOPLE, IN ANY WAY OR FORM, PLEASE DNI. I'm talking people who support pedos, etc.

PLEASE DNI IF YOU BRING UP ANY ADULT TOPICS TOO. I'M STILL A MINOR, HAHA..

DOUBLES ALSO DON'T INTERACT UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT..


IWC IF..
If you support problematic games like TCOAAL, etc.
if you bring up any ships. i dislike ships.

IF you act offensive and/or rude to my friendos.


I GET UNCOMFORTABLE WITH CONVERSATIONS THAT LAST TOO LONG, AND I USUALLY TALK WITH MYSELF ON PONY TOWN TO RELIEVE STRESS. If you see me talking to myself don't hesitate to int! i don't bite..


dni if you bring up any war topics. i'll block you right away. 
i DO unblock if i don't forget you exist that is... i'm working on it..

i usually use a star when i talk,
☆ , like this!
this means i'm just neutral and don't really care whether you int or not.

but i can also speak with a dagger emoji, which means i encourage you to int anytime! i feel lonely when using this.

using a music note indicates i want to be left alone.


also dni if you support souldrivenlove. idk.

hazbin hotel please iwec.
angel dust cosplays HEAVY DNI I DONT LIKE HIM AAAAAAAHAHSNNSNSNSHEHQ 
ok anyways idk what that was...

i like tea.
i do not eat much avian meat because i believe it's like cannibalism? i don't know how to explain it.

i usually am pretty drained/tired, and i don't really get much of the concept of sleep. i have paranoia of sleep paralysis and it gives me this sort of insomnia.

dni if you support the creators of LOL dolls.

ALSO, Shedletskies can interact, i don't mind them as long as they don't bring up being the same person, which i strongly disbelieve.

i also would like it if forsaken please iwc. not for any reason other than the fans piss me off sometimes..

if i am AFK, DNI!! DNI DNI DNI! I cannot come back to 2763 whispers i swear i'm not a super typer
also, i am a slow-ish typer, do not expect fast responses from me.
