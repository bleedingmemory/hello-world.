# hello-world.
i hear everything.
i see everyone.

but i wonder..
why don't i see you the same?
you're... different.

| ~

why do you even bother glancing my way if all i've done is hurt you?
if i've been too clingy, too obsessive?

if i hadn't let you leave me before, why put your trust in me again?

i'm simply a needy puppy.
what do you see in me?

why excuse my terrible actions?
why give me another chance, -----?
why do you still see me as someone to look up to?

putting this here instead of my tiktok cuz my irl friends see my tiktok and judge a lot so.

hello, i'm ray, call me telamon or ashswagg if you don't know me. they/them or he/him preferred please!
only azel can call me she/her, hi azel if youre reading this,,

if i seem dry or insulting, please, give me a chance. i warm up quite quickly if i like you.
c+h always, unless i'm with a friend. 

if i use a star in my speech, you're free to c+h.
if i use a dagger, you can interact freely!!
a star and a music note means iwcare, unless you're azel or kier!
if i use a music note alone, dni unless azel or kier, again!

i develop obsessions and attatchments quite quickly, so please tell me if i get too possessive/obsessive of you. i'm a stupid oblivious mutt, so it shouldn't be too hard. i follow orders quite well.

please spare me, i'm trying my best to fix my attatchment issues. 

and if you like my obsession by rare chance,, i'd make myself worse for you. i would destroy myself for you <3 
i would worsen my issues for you.
wait did that come off as creepy...?
i promise i'm not creepy.
i swear to illumina i'm not.

always YES to : 
matching ponies with oomfs,
(FRIENDS ONLY) cuddling/covering me,
(azel, kier, key and tacky only) kissing me!

addie can do all. i know she hasn't been online in a year, but just in case she comes back,,
i've been waiting.
don't keep me waiting like this, addie.
i haven't forgotten you.
i'm sorry.

automatic NO to :

strangers being freaky (friends be as freaky as you want! i don't CARE!)
random ponies interacting before i do!
crowning my ponies. just no.
calling my friends bad words with actual bad intent.

that's quite it.. yeah.. i'm not that interesting..

just some puppy who wants friends ^^
please be my friend.
i beg you.
must i beg more?
